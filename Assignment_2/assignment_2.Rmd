# {.tabset}
## libraries
There are few libraries that is to be installed

I used RMariaDB package to connect to MySQL

```{r}
## install.packages("RMariaDB")
library(RMariaDB)
```

```{r}
library("RMySQL")
library("DT")
library("knitr")
library("reshape2")
library("tidyr")
library(ggplot2)

## Movie Survey

I created a google form survey to collect movie ratings from 5 of my friends

```{r}

knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/Admin/Documents/data 607/assignment_2/image.jpg")
```


## Connetion to MySQL Database


(a) Add a user to connect to the database
(b) Create an R script that connects to the database

Connecting to the database with a password

```{r}
localuserpassword <- "data607@19"
movieDb <- dbConnect(RMariaDB::MariaDB(), user='data607', password=localuserpassword, dbname='movie_rating', host='localhost')

```

List tables in movieDb and display table movie_survey
```{r}
dbListTables(movieDb)
movieRatings <- dbGetQuery( movieDb, "select
Name, Movie_Name,Ratings from movie_survey" )
datatable(movieRatings)

```


## Analyzing the datatable

Aggregate of the movie ratings

```{r}
movieRatingsAgg <- dcast( movieRatings, Movie_Name~Ratings)
kable( movieRatingsAgg )

```


Maximum no. of ratings a movie got

```{r}
most_rated <- dbGetQuery(movieDb, "select Movie_Name, count(Ratings)
                 from movie_survey")
most_rated
```

Creating a bar plot of the Movie rating

```{r}
ggplot(movieRatings, aes(movieRatings$Movie_Name, fill = Ratings)) +
geom_bar(stat = "count")

```

Close the connection
```{r}
dbDisconnect(movieDb)
```
